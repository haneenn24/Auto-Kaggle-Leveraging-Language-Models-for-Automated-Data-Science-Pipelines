# The dataset contains the following columns:
# Names: The name of the customer.
# Age: The age of the customer.
# Total_Purchase: The total amount of purchases made by the customer.
# Account_Manager: A binary indicator of whether the customer has an account manager.
# Years: The number of years the customer has been with the company.
# Num_Sites: The number of sites the customer is associated with.
# Onboard_date: The date the customer was onboarded.
# Location: The location of the customer.
# Company: The company of the customer.
# Churn: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

# Tasks:
# Perform initial data analysis to understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
# Handle any missing values or data cleaning if necessary.
# Generate code to preprocess the data, including feature engineering and handling categorical variables.
# Train a machine learning model to predict the Churn variable.
# Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
# Provide the final code and results.

### Interpretation:
# - The model performs well in predicting non-churn customers (precision 0.89, recall 0.97).
# - The model has a lower performance in predicting churn customers (precision 0.75, recall 0.47).
# - Overall accuracy is 87.8%.
