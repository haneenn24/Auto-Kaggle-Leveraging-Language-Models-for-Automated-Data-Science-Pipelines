improvement_prompt = f"""
    Iteratively improve the model's performance based on the comparison with the benchmark solution found at {benchmark_solution_url} and by finding additional benchmarks from Kaggle or other communities.
    Here are some methods to improve model performance:
    1. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Create Interaction Features: Combine features to capture interactions.
    - Polynomial Features: Add polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.
    - Domain-Specific Features: Create features based on domain knowledge.

    2. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
    - Oversampling: Use techniques like SMOTE to balance the classes.
    - Undersampling: Reduce the number of samples in the majority class.
    - Class Weights: Adjust the weights of the classes in the loss function.

    3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Grid Search: Exhaustively search over a specified parameter grid.
    - Random Search: Randomly sample parameters from a specified distribution.
    - Bayesian Optimization: Use probabilistic models to find the optimal hyperparameters.

    4. **Ensemble Methods**:
    - Bagging: Combine multiple models trained on different subsets of the data (e.g., Random Forest).
    - Boosting: Sequentially train models to correct the errors of previous models (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost).
    - Stacking: Combine predictions from multiple models using a meta-model.

    5. **Model Selection**:
    - Try Different Algorithms: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to find the best one for your data.
    - Model Complexity: Adjust the complexity of the model (e.g., depth of decision trees, number of layers in neural networks).

    6. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Scaling/Normalization: Scale numerical features to have a similar range.
    - Imputation: Handle missing values using strategies like mean, median, or mode imputation.
    - Encoding: Convert categorical features into numerical format (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).

    7. **Cross-Validation**:
    - K-Fold Cross-Validation: Divide the data into k subsets and train/test the model k times.
    - Stratified Sampling: Ensure that each fold has a similar distribution of classes.

    8. **Regularization**:
    - L1/Lasso: Adds a penalty for non-zero coefficients, encouraging sparsity.
    - L2/Ridge: Adds a penalty for large coefficients, encouraging smaller coefficients.

    9. **Early Stopping**:
    - Monitor Validation Performance: Stop training when the performance on a validation set stops improving to prevent overfitting.

    10. **Data Augmentation**:
        - Synthetic Data: Generate synthetic data to increase the size and diversity of the training set.
        - Transformations: Apply transformations (e.g., rotations, scaling) to create new training samples.
